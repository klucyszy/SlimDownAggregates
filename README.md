# SlimDownAggregates
In this repository I want to practice building small aggregates as explained by Oskar Dudycz.

## Getting started

On one of Oskar's webinars he proposed a really great way to tackle the problem of building and slimming down aggregates. Using Chat GPT I've generated the random aggregate of a library membership, which I will use as a starting point for this repository and is located in the `Original` folder.

Folder `Slimmed` consists of the slimmed down version of the aggregate. 

## Examples

### Library membership
